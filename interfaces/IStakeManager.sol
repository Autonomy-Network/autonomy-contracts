     *          We want the staker to be chosen proportional to their stake, which requires
     *          knowing their stake in relation to everyone else. If you could stake any
     *          amount of AUTO tokens, then the contract would have to store that amount
     *          along with the staker and, crucially, would require iteration over the
     *          whole array. E.g. if the random number in this PoS system was 0.2, then
     *          you could calculate the amount of proportional stake that translates to.
     *          If the total stakes was 10^6, then whichever staker in the array at token
     *          position 200,000 would be the winner, but that requires going through every
     *          piece of staking info in the first part of the array in order to calculate
     *          the running cumulative and know who happens to have the slot where the
     *          cumulative stake is 200,000. This has problems when the staking array is
     *          so large that it costs more than the block gas limit to iterate over, which
     *          would brick the contract, but also just generally costs alot of gas. Having
     *          a set amount of AUTO tokens means you already know everything about every
     *          element in the array therefore don't need to iterate over it.
     *          Calling this will add the caller to the array. Calling this will first try

     *              by the end of the array...but i=3 no longer exists, so it'll revert. In this
     *              case, `idxs` would need to be [1, 1], which would result in [a, c]. It's
     *              recommended to choose idxs in descending order so that you don't have to
