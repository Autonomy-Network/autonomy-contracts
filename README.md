# autonomy-contracts

Autonomy Network is a protocol for decentralised automation.
These smart contracts, mainly `Registry`, serve as the connection point between users who want requests to be executed, and executors who want to execute things in return for a small bounty. A quick intro for the whole system can be found [here](https://blog.autonomynetwork.io/how-autonomy-works-simple-6c0059a2ee89).

This repo uses [brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) to test. To run these tests, use `brownie test --stateful false`
